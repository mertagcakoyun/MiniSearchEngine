Computer data is in what is called binary format. This means that it is always a 0 or a 1. It only has these two states and must be in one of them. Bit is a data unit which must be in one of the two binary states described above. It is the smallest data unit that exists.\cf2 In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures provide a means to manage huge amounts of data efficiently.}
